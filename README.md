# ObjectSync #

ObjectSync generates object synchronization code for C# projects. Properties that synchronize amongst instances are generated using attributes found in `ObjectSync.Attributes`. A demonstration project can be found in `ObjectSync.TestApp`.

Applications include data consolidation in a client-server context, between domain-entities of the same identity, and more.

Please console the [ObjectSync.Attributes readme](https://github.com/PaulBraetz/ObjectSync/tree/master/Attributes) for information on how to use this generator.
